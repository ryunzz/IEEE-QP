# Hello we are, IEEE QP Fall 2024 Team 1!

# Introduction
Our project, "Power Tag" aims to create a versatile, chargeable power bank for mobile devices equipped with a solar panel for sustainable charging (will also have a USB Type C connector to charge the power bank faster) and a GPS tracking feature via GSM communication. Users can monitor the location of their device & luggage through a mobile app we developed for this project, utilizing various API calls from and to Google Maps API & Blynk API. We decided to go through with the GSM communication route as it allows for connecting to the internet without the need for a physical Wi-Fi router/connection (WiFi is not garunteed to the device if it's lost). This innovation is designed to enhance portability, provide off-grid power solutions, and offer security for tracked items



# Inspiration
We've all been there: fantasizing about your freshly smuggled $5 Costco rotisserie chicken you got past TSA, BUT ALAS, while you were in the bathroom someone stole your bag!! Over 1.8 million bags are stolen annually, and it's quite frustrating to lose your most prized possesions durring your vacation, but that's where Power Tag comes in! Power Tag is more than just a portable charger; it features a GPS tracking system that helps you keep tabs on your luggage to locate and prevent you from being a statistic and returning your unlicenced $5 Costco rotisserie chicken.
