# Hello we are, IEEE QP Fall 2024 Team 1!
Ryan Ni, May Hong, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___

# Introduction
Our project, "Power Tag" aims to create a versatile, chargeable power bank for mobile devices equipped with a solar panel for sustainable charging (will also have a USB Type C connector to charge the power bank faster) and a GPS tracking feature via GSM communication. Users can monitor the location of their device & luggage through a mobile app we developed for this project, utilizing various API calls from and to Google Maps API & Blynk API. We decided to go through with the GSM communication route as it allows for connecting to the internet without the need for a physical Wi-Fi router/connection (WiFi is not garunteed to the device if it's lost). This innovation is designed to enhance portability, provide off-grid power solutions, and offer security for tracked items

# Overview
Here are some quick links to some of the resources we developed while creating our project:

⚒️ • Prototype (coming soon) Parts are on their way! 

📐 • Figma? (coming soon) We'll see LOL

📢 • Pitchdeck (coming soon) Will be created closer to dead line

📕 • Documentation (coming soon) Ryan's working on it ;-;
