# What is our Project?
Our project, "Power Tag" aims to create a versatile, chargeable power bank for mobile devices equipped with a solar panel for sustainable charging ( will also have a USB Type C connector to charge the power bank faster) and a GPS tracking feature. Users can monitor the location of their device & luggage through a mobile app we will develop for this project, utilizing HTTPs API calls and GSM communication for connecting to the internet without the need for a physical Wi-Fi router. This innovation is designed to enhance portability, provide off-grid power solutions, and offer security for tracked items.
