# Hello IEEE QP Team 1!

This will be our Git Hub repo for our project! If you have any ideas or things that you're going to work on please let the discord gc know before doing so :D



U can use this document to learn/remind urself the process for creating and managing feature branches and keeping them in sync with the `main` branch to ensure we dont have lots of merge conflicts.
