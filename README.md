# Hello IEEE QP Team 1!

This will be our Git Hub repo for our project! If you have any ideas or things that you're going to work on please let the discord gc know before doing so :D



U can use this document to learn/remind urself the process for creating and managing feature branches and keeping them in sync with the `main` branch to ensure we dont have lots of merge conflicts.

---

## 1. Setup

### Clone the repository

Start by cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory:

if u wanna do this using the command line u do;

```bash
echo "# PiB-Ultra-Wideband-UWB" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/jphung101/PiB-Ultra-Wideband-UWB.git
git push -u origin main
```


or push an existing repository from the command line;
